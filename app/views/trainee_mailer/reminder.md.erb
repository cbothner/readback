Dear <%=@trainee %>,

It's been three months since you first came down to check WCBN out; is your demo in?  Have you done Stage II?  Maybe you're already on the air?!

If you've got any questions, whether it's about finishing your demo, or learning to use Prod A to engineer live performances, making a promotional cart for your show, or getting involved with the exec board, hit us up.  Just reply to this email, and we'll get back to you ASAP.

And if you've still got some work to do, hop to it!  Having a show on the radio will be awesome!  Here's a refresher on the how-to:

Keep on keepin' on,
