Hey <%= @trainee %>,

It's been a week since you came to Stage One Training at WCBN.  We hope you've finished up your two hours of alphabetizing and are beginning to work on your demo.  About that, here are some things to keep in mind:

* Variety!  Use this as a chance to check out a jazz artist you don't know much about, or some music from halfway around the world.  Get some experience with vinyl, too.  Remember, we're not really judging you on your music tastes, so feel free to get out of your comfort zone.

* Do it live!  Many people want to meticulously plan out their demos, and while some preparation is certainly for the better, the demo is only the first of many sets you'll do on the radio: feel free to just grab a stack of music, and play it by ear.

* Get some help.  If you want some help with the mixing board or the turntable, or if you just want to get to know some of us, come by during office hours.  Reply to this email for the up-to-date times.

See you around,
