1. Do your hour of alphabetizing.  This will help you familiarize yourself with our library and will make the demo tape process much easier for you.  It's a quick hour!
2. Make your demo tape!  Grab the key block from the DJ---call (734) 763-3500 if you need to be buzzed into the SAB---and get into Prod C and go!  Remember, we're looking for *variety*.  Get outside your comfort zone.
3. Do your Stage II Training.  This is where stuff really gets fun; Stage II is where you get to do some DJing on the radio.
4. Do your apprenticeships. Hang out with 2 freeform and 2 specialty show DJs.  These folks will give you even more experience with the our nationally renowed brand of freeform radio.
5. Get on the schedule!

If you have any questions during this process, shoot us an email!  You can just reply to this message and we'll get back to you ASAP.
