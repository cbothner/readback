1. Do your hours of alphabetizing soon.  This will help you familiarize yourself with our library and will make the demo process much easier for you.  Start anywhere you like, or find a section not alphabetized recently.
2. Make your digital demo!  Grab the key block from the DJ---call (734) 763-3500 if you need to be buzzed into the SAB---and get into Prod C and go!  Remember, we're looking for *variety*.  Get outside your comfort zone. If you have any questions about steps/equipment, donâ€™t hesitate to email. This video might help, too: [how to cue a record](https://youtu.be/5piOf6LvqHw).
3. Do your Stage II Training.  This is where stuff really gets fun; Stage II is where you get to do some DJing on the radio.
4. Do your apprenticeships. Hang out with 2 freeform DJs and 1 specialty show DJ.  These folks will give you even more experience with the our nationally renowed brand of freeform radio.
5. Get on the schedule!

If you have any questions during this process, shoot us an email!  You can just reply to this message and we'll get back to you ASAP.
