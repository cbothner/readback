        WCBN is a student-run, and primarily student-staffed station.  The role of
        community voluteers on the air is limited to an educational and/or
        advisory role, meaning that community volunteers must have something
        concrete to give the station, such as exceptional music knowledge,
        technical expertise, or previous radio experience.  Please explain why
        you'd like to join WCBN, what you propose to do here, and in what ways you
        would like to become involved.  What do you have to offer WCBN on-air and
        off?  Please know that DJs are required to match their on-air hours with
        off-air work at the station.  Do you have the time for this kind of
        commitment?  What would your contribution be?
